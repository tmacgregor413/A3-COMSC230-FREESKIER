                        <h3>Rentals</h3>
                        <p>
                            Always remember your gear. If you have purchased your own skis, helmet, boots, and poles, you're already one step ahead. However, if you do not have your own gear, do not worry. You can alway rent gear from the resort lodge. Price varies depending on the location, but usually will average from $40-$60 total. Renting gear is a perfectly good option. Ski resorts ensure that you have proper gear that is proper quality. If you are not sure if you are serious about skiing yet, or just go on ocassion, renting ski gear is probably your best option.

                        <h3>Clothing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Of course, the mountain is cold. Beginning and middle season skiing, also depending on where you are, will have you very cold at the top of the mountain (or when you're face first in the snow). Although you can get a little warm from the activity, you always want to make sure you are properly covered so you avoid windburn or frostbite. To do this, it is recommended you have waterproof snowpants, a waterproof winter jacket, an under jacket layer, thick socks, a face mask, gloves, and goggles. It is better to have more layers and not need them to than to need them and not have them. Thermals are also a good option to keep you warm under all of your clothes. This may be a little expensive, but will hopefully be a one time purchase. Ski pants and a ski jacket that do the job can probably be found places each for somewhere around $100-$200 or up.

                        <h3>Owned Gear</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you think you are serious about skiing, go out and buy yourself some gear and avoid that rental fee every time you buy a ticket. Purchasing your own gear can also help you become more confident and make the learning process easier since you are comfortable in a set of skis. If you are looking to buy your own gear, it will probably be around $600 for some new, decent quality gear. Of course, there is buying used. This will save you a pretty penny and is a great option when starting out or even for replacement gear. Another good tip is to make sure that if you own your own gear, keep up with tune ups on your skis, check your helmet's condition, and make sure you have reflective goggle for day skiing, and clear lens goggles for night skiing. Low visibility while skiing can cause serious accidents and may lead to injury
